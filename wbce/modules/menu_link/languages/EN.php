$MOD_MENU_LINK['R-200-INFO'] = 'No redirect is performed, and the requested resource is served successfully. The &raquo;200 OK&laquo; status code indicates that the requested resource was found and successfully served. If you use this status code for redirection, it means that the original URL and the redirected URL will both return the same content. This can create duplicate versions of the same content, which can negatively impact search engine optimization (SEO) and user experience.';
